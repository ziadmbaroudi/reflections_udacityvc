What I have learnt about Git so far:
1- to create a new repository, cd to relevant directory and type:
> git init
2- > git status: shows any untracked changes
3- > git add <filename>: adds the file with that name to the staging area
4- > git commit: commits the files in the staging area to the repository
5- > git diff:
   > git diff: Difference between staging area and last checkout (not incl unadded files!)
   > git diff --staged: difference between staging area and last version in repository
   > git diff id1 id2: difference between two commits
